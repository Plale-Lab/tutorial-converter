        <p>Let me try rewriting the content in a way that's even more suitable for a 5th grader.</p>
<h3>Tutorial | ICICLE AI Institute - Training Catalog</h3>
<h4>Harvest</h4>
<p>To use Harvest, you need an Internet browser and to contact us at <code>icicle_harvest@osu.edu</code> for a trial account. A user guide with estimated learning time is available <a href="https://...">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What can you do in Harvest?</strong>
You can:
- Train a model (like creating a robot)
- Use the trained model to make predictions on new data</p>
<h3>Training Use Case</h3>
<p>On the dashboard page, select <strong>Training</strong>. If you want to clean up your data before training, choose preprocessing.</p>
<h4>Important Settings</h4>
<p>Fill in the requested information:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Location</strong>: Where is your data stored on our powerful computers? You can browse for it or type in the path.</li>
<li><strong>Learning Rate</strong>: How fast do you want the model to learn? It's like adjusting a bicycle gear – if it's too hard, the bike won't move!</li>
<li><strong>Batch Size</strong>: How many examples do you want to use at a time? A smaller batch size is like reading one book at a time, while a larger batch size is like reading all your books at once.</li>
<li><strong>Number of Training Epochs</strong>: How many times do you want the model to see all the data? It's like repeating a math problem until you get it right!</li>
</ul>
<h4>Other Settings</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Number of GPUs Used</strong>: How many powerful computers will work together to train the model?</li>
<li><strong>Training Algorithm</strong>: What type of learning does the model use? It can be supervised (like following a recipe) or semi-supervised (like having some hints and guessing the rest).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Inference Use Case</h3>
<p>On the dashboard page, select <strong>Inference</strong>. If you want to clean up your data before using the model, choose preprocessing.</p>
<h4>Important Settings</h4>
<p>Fill in the requested information:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Location</strong>: Where is your data stored on our powerful computers? You can browse for it or type in the path.</li>
<li><strong>Inference Model Name</strong>: What's the name of the trained model you want to use?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Preprocessing</h3>
<p><strong>What is preprocessing?</strong>
It's like cleaning up a messy room – you sort and organize your images so they're easier to work with.</p>
<h4>Crop Images (Data preprocessing)</h4>
<p>On the dashboard page, select "Crop Images".</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Source Image Directory</strong>: Where are the images you want to crop?</li>
<li><strong>Destination Image Directory</strong>: Where do you want to save the cropped images?</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="A kid in front of a computer, with a messy room and a tidy one behind them" src="static/image_kids_0.png" /></p>
<h4>Inference</h4>
<p>You need to run Preprocessing and Inference steps together.</p>
<ol>
<li>Object Detector:</li>
</ol>
<p>On the dashboard page, select "Object Detector".</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Filesystem System</strong>: What system will you use to store your data?</li>
<li><strong>Input Path</strong>: Where are the images you want to analyze?</li>
<li><strong>Class Name</strong>: Give a name to the class of objects you're looking for (e.g., "car", "tree").</li>
<li><strong>Search Terms</strong>: Describe the objects you want to detect.</li>
<li><strong>Confidence Threshold</strong>: How sure do you want the model to be about its answers?</li>
</ul>

<p>I hope this rewritten version meets your requirements!</p>
