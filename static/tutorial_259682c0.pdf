        <p>Let's rewrite the content in a way that's easy for 5th graders to understand!</p>
<p><strong>Shapefile Generation: A Fun Project!</strong></p>
<h3>On the Dashboard Page</h3>
<p>Hey, let's get started! On this page, you can choose what project you want to work on. Select "Shapefile Generation" if you're excited about it!</p>
<h4>Required Information: Let's Get Started!</h4>
<p>Imagine we need some information to create a treasure map for farmers. Fill in all the requested details:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Filesystem System</strong>: Pick a special tool that helps us understand images (like expanse-tapis).</li>
<li><strong>Result JSON file</strong>: Find and select a special file that has secrets about the pictures. This file should have three important things:<ul>
<li><strong>Image name</strong> (required): The name or path of the picture.</li>
<li><strong>Label</strong> (required): A word to describe what's in the picture (like "cow" or "tree").</li>
<li><strong>Bounding boxes</strong> (required): These are like little rectangles that help us find where objects are in the pictures.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Images directory</strong>: Find a folder with all the pictures we just talked about. Make sure the names match!</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="A picture of a folder with images and a map" src="static/image_kids_0.png" /></p>
<h4>Grid Configuration: Time to Get Organized!</h4>
<p>Think of a big grid like a piece of graph paper. We need to set up some rules for our treasure map:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grid Width (feet)</strong>: Decide how wide each square on the grid should be (default is 30 feet).</li>
<li><strong>Grid Height (feet)</strong>: Decide how tall each square on the grid should be (default is also 30 feet).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Spray Level Configuration: Let's Make It More Fun!</h4>
<p>Imagine we have different levels of excitement for our farmers! We can create custom spray levels with special names and rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Binary Mode</strong> (default): If this mode is on, our map will show if a spot needs "Yes" (spray) or "No" (no spray).</li>
<li><strong>Custom Spray Levels</strong>: Let's add more excitement! We can define multiple spray levels with their own rules:<ul>
<li>Click "Add Level" to create new levels.</li>
<li>For each level, give it a cool name and set a secret code (threshold value) that determines when to use it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Visualization Page: Time to See Our Map!</h4>
<p>This page is like a magic window where we can see our treasure map come alive:</p>
<ul>
<li>A special list shows pictures without matching images in the folder.</li>
<li>Choose a label from the dropdown menu, and we'll create a map just for that!</li>
<li>Click "Show Heatmap" to load the map on the screen with colors that show spray levels.</li>
</ul>
<p>The heatmap is like a colorful game board where:
* <strong>Binary Mode</strong>: No color (No_spray) means no excitement, Colored (Spray) means it's time for fun!
* <strong>Custom Spray Levels</strong>: Each level you created will have its own special color on the map!</p>
<h4>Downloading the Shapefile: The Final Step!</h4>
<p>Now that we've made our treasure map, let's download it so farmers can use it! Use the + and – buttons to zoom in and out of the map.</p>
<p>The "Download Shapeﬁle" button will zip up the map for us.</p>
